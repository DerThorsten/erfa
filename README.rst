Fundamental Astronomy).  ERFA is a C library containing key algorithms for 
astronomy, and is based on the SOFA library published by the International 
Astronomical Union (IAU).  

It is intended to replicate the functionality of SOFA (aside from possible
bugfixes in ERFA that have not yet been included in SOFA), but is licensed
under a three-clause BSD license to enable its compatibility with a wide 
range of open source licenses. Permission for this release has been
